The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the
room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the
table below
, which trembled and creaked. Several of
the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell
out of his onto the floor

“Dinner

, and the great
snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto
the polished wood.

IN MEMORIAM
Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his
left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered
www.ztcprep.com
 open his bedroom door
. There was a crunch of
breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea
that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom
door
.
“What the — ?”
He looked around; the landing of number four
, Privet
Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was
Dudley’
s idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his
bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments
of cup together with the other hand and threw them
into the already crammed bin just visible inside his
bedroom door
. Then he tramped across to the
bathroom to run his finger under the tap.
It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that
he still had four days left of being unable to perform
magic … but he had to admit to himself that this
jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He
P a g e 
| 16
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – J.K. Rowling
had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he
www.ztcprep.com
 came to think of it — particularly in light of his
immediate plans — this seemed a serious flaw in his
magical education. Making a mental note to ask
Hermione how it was done, he used a lar
ge wad of
toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could,
before returning to his bedroom and slamming the
door behind him.
Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his
school trunk for the first time since he had packed it
six years ago. At the start of the intervening school
years, he had merely skimmed of
f the topmost three
quarters of the contents and replaced or updated
them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom
— old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that
no longer fit. Minutes previously
, Harry had plunged
his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain
in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn
it to see a lot of blood.
He now proceeded a little more cautiously
. Kneeling
down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the
www.ztcprep.com
 bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that
flickered feebly between 
Support CEDRIC DIGGOR
Y
and 
POTTER STINKS, 
a cracked and worn-out
Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note
signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered
the sharp edge that had done the damage. He
recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment
of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather
,
Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt
cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing
more remained of his godfather
’
s last gift except
powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of
debris like glittering grit.
Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which
he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright
P a g e 
| 17
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – J.K. Rowling
green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the
fragment on top of that morning’
s 
Daily Pr
ophet,
which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem
www.ztcprep.com
 the sudden upsur
ge of bitter memories, the stabs of
regret and of longing the discovery of the broken
mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the
rubbish in the trunk.
It took another hour to empty it completely
, throw
away the useless items, and sort the remainder in
piles according to whether or not he would need them
from now on. His school and Quidditch robes,
cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his
textbooks were piled in a corner
, to be left behind. He
wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with
them; burn them in the dead of night, probably
, as if
they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His
Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit,
certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once
given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been
repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were
the Marauder
’
s Map and the locket with the note
signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this
place of honor not because it was valuable — in all
www.ztcprep.com
 usual senses it was worthless — but because of what
it had cost to attain it.
This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his
desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of
the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this
summer
.
He got up of
f the floor
, stretched, and moved across to
his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to
flick through the newspapers, throwing them onto the
rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else
faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited
amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the
moment.

As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers,
Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue
that he knew had arrived shortly after he had
returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he
remembered that there had been a small mention on
www.ztcprep.com
 the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage,
the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he
found it. T
urning to page ten, he sank into his desk
chair and reread the article he had been looking for
.
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED
by Elphias Doge
I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our
first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was
undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt
ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon
pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was
no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and
greenish hue did not encourage many to approach
me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts
under the burden of unwanted notoriety
. Scarcely a
year previously
, his father
, Percival, had been
convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon
three young Muggles.
Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who
was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on
www.ztcprep.com
 the contrary
, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he
assur
ed me that he knew his father to be guilty
.
Beyond that, Dumbledor
e r
efused to speak of the sad
business, though many attempted to make him do so.
Some, indeed, wer
e disposed to praise his father
’
s
action and assumed that Albus too was a
 Muggle-
hater
. They could not have been more mistaken: As
anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never
revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency
. Indeed,
P a g e 
| 19
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – J.K. Rowling
his determined support for Muggle rights gained him
many enemies in subsequent years.
In a matter of months, however
, Albus’
s own fame
had begun to eclipse that of his father
. By the end of
his first year he would never again be known as the
son of a Muggle-hater
, but as nothing more or less
than the most brilliant student ever seen at the
school. Those of us who were privileged to be his
friends benefited from his example, not to mention his
www.ztcprep.com
 help and encouragement, with which he was always
generous. He confessed to me in later life that he
knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in
teaching.
He not only won every prize of note that the school
offer
ed, he was soon in r
egular corr
espondence with
the most notable magical names of the day
, including
Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda
Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert W
affling,
the magical theor
etician. Several of his papers found
their way into learned publications such as
T
ransfiguration T
oday
, Challenges in Charming, 
and
The Practical Potioneer 
. 
Dumbledor
e’
s futur
e car
eer
seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question
that r
emained was when he would become Minister of
Magic. Though it was often pr
edicted in later years that
he was on the point of taking the job, however
, he
never had Ministerial ambitions.
Thr
ee years after we had started at Hogwarts, 
Albus’
s
br
other
, Aberforth, arrived at school. They wer
e not
www.ztcprep.com
 alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus,
pr
eferr
ed to settle ar
guments by dueling rather than
thr
ough r
easoned discussion. However
, it is quite
wr
ong to suggest, as some have, that the br
others
wer
e not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as
two such differ
ent boys could do. In fairness to
Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus’
s
P a g e 
| 20
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – J.K. Rowling
shadow cannot have been an altogether
 comfortable experience. Being
continually outshone was an
occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot
have been any more pleasurable as a brother
.
When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take
the then-traditional tour of the world together
, visiting
and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our
separate careers. However
, tragedy intervened. On the
very eve of our trip, Albus’
s mother
, Kendra, died,
leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner
, of the
family
. I postponed my departure long enough to pay
my respects at Kendra’
s funeral, then left for what
www.ztcprep.com
 was now to be a solitary journey
. W
ith a younger
brother and sister to care for
, and little gold left to
them, there could no longer be any question of Albus
accompanying me.
That was the period of our lives when we had least
contact. I wr
ote to Albus, describing, per
haps
insensitively
, the wonders of my journey
, fr
om narr
ow
escapes fr
om chimaeras in Gr
eece to the experiments
of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of
his
 day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly
dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own
experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward
the end of my year
’
s travels, that yet another tragedy
had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister
,
Ariana.
Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long
time, the blow
, coming so soon after the loss of their
mother
, had a profound ef
fect on both of her
brothers. All those closest to Albus — and I count
myself one of that lucky number — agree that
www.ztcprep.com
 Ariana’
s death, and Albus’
s feeling of personal
responsibility for it (though, of course, he was
guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore.
P a g e 
| 21
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – J.K. Rowling
I r
eturned home to find a young man who had
experienced a much older person’
s suffering. Albus
was mor
e r
eserved than befor
e, and much less light-
hearted. T
o add to his misery
, the loss of Ariana had
led, not to a r
enewed closeness between Albus and
Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would
lift — in later years they r
eestablished, if not a close
relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However
,
he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then
on, and his friends learned not to mention them.
Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following
years. Dumbledor
e’
s innumerable contributions to the
stor
e of W
izar
ding knowledge, including
 
his discovery
of the twelve uses of dragon’
s blood, will benefit
generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed
www.ztcprep.com
 in the many judgments he made while Chief W
arlock of
the W
izengamot. They say
, still, that no W
izar
ding duel
ever matched that between Dumbledor
e and
Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have
written of the terr
or and the awe they felt as they
watched these two extraor
dinary wizar
ds do battle.
Dumbledor
e’
s triumph, and its consequences for the
W
izar
ding world, ar
e consider
ed a turning point in
magical history to match the intr
oduction of the
International Statute of Secr
ecy or the downfall of He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Albus Dumbledor
e was never pr
oud or vain; 
he could
find something to value in anyone, however
apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe
that his early losses endowed him with great
humanity and sympathy
. I shall miss his friendship
more than I can say
, but my loss is as nothing
compared to the W
izarding world’
s. That he was the
most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts
headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he
www.ztcprep.com
 lived: working always for the greater good and, to his
last hour
, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small
P a g e

boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met
him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the
picture accompanying the obituary
. Dumbledore was
wearing his familiar
, kindly smile, but as he peered
over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the
impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry
,
whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but
ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to
recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never
once had he imagined Dumbledore’
s childhood or
youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as
Harry had known him, venerable and silver
-haired
and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was
simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione
www.ztcprep.com
 or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his
past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent
even, but after all, it had been common knowledge
that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary
duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to
ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about
any of his other famous achievements. No, they had
always discussed Harry
, Harry’
s past, Harry’
s future,
Harry’
s plans … and it seemed to Harry now
, despite
the fact that his future was so dangerous and so
uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable
opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore
more about himself, even though the only personal
question he had ever asked his headmaster was also
the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not
answered honestly:
“
What do you see when you look in the mirr
or
?”

 “
I
? 
I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. 
”
After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the
obituary out of the 
Pr
ophet, 
folded it carefully
, and
tucked it inside the first volume of 
Practical Defensive
Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. 
Then he
threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile
and turned to face the room. It was much tidier
. The
only things left out of place were today’
s 
Daily
Pr
ophet, 
still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the
piece of broken mirror
.
Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror
fragment of
f today’
s 
Pr
ophet, 
and unfolded the
newspaper
. He had merely glanced at the headline
when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the
delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside,
after noting that it said nothing about V
oldemort.
Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the
Pr
ophet
 to suppress news about V
oldemort. It was
only now
, therefore, that he saw what he had missed.
Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller
www.ztcprep.com
 headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore
striding along looking harried:
DUMBLEDORE — THE TRUTH A
T LAST?
Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed
genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard
of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of
serene, silver
-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals
the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the
lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore
carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be
Minister of Magic content to remain a mere
headmaster? WHA
T was the real purpose of the secret
